# Digit-Recognition
A project in kaggle competitions classify digits from 0-9.<br/>
Converted the Image data as matrix of pixel values <br/>
Used categorical cross entropy as loss function and standard deviation to reduce cost. <br/>
Used dense layers from keras and also used dropout layers to avoid overfitting.<br/>
used multi layer convolution layers with categorical output.<br/>
used skit learn and keras libraries and taken input data as a matrix of pixel values as csv. got an accuracy of 98
percent on validation set.<br/>
